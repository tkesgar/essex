Hi there, my name is Ted Kesgar. I graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering.

I currently live in Jakarta, working at Bukalapak as software engineer while also maintaining [Nusa League](https://www.nusaleague.com) and [Charaverse](https://www.charaverse.com). At my spare time, I draw illustrations, write comics, and play video games.

You can check out my works at [GitHub](https://github.com/tkesgar). If you want to contact me, I am available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tkesgar) or feel free to [send me an email](mailto:t.kesgar@outlook.com).
