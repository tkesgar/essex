## About this page

This website is created using [Next.js][nextjs] using configurations from [@tkesgar/sharo-next][sharo-next], exported and served in my personal server. It is certainly overkill for a single read-only page to use React, but at the time of this writing I don't have time to learn other frameworks, duh.

The source code is available [here][gh-tkesgar.com].
