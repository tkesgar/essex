## Current works

### Nusa Mascot League

Nusa Mascot League is a competition for Indonesian community mascot characters.
I handled the whole tech stack, from dev ops to front-end websites.

The website is available [here](https://www.nusaleague.com/).

Many of the works are private-scoped (only available for staffs or members), but
we have the public GitHub organization [here](https://github.com/nusaleague),
intended for when we will publish some codes.

I left the staff position at May 2019, but I am still hanging around to maintain
and develop the tech stuffs.
